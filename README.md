# senior-capstone
A copy of my senior-project capstone. A webapp called "key management system" to manage door keys (lending and returning) at a university.

I have removed certain files and past documentation in the interest of security and privacy. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at pasha.ranak@gmail.com

As this repo was used for a university project, it should NOT be used in any other academic assignment as code here could be picked up by plagiarism detectors.
